# Chord2.0
## A remake of the [Chord](https://github.com/larzeitlin/Chord) project

Setup using [this](https://github.com/AhmadMoussa/Python-Midi-Ableton/blob/master/Readme.md)
---
This project use rtmidi and threading.

####*Rtmidi need c++ building tools(ver 14+)*
---
This python app will run on windows and hopefully can be used on more than one DAW.

First version here(I dont recommend using the input fields...)

There is still **much** to work but hopefully *someday* it will be finished
